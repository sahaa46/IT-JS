        <p id="tekst">Crnjanski was born in Csongrád, Hungary, to an impoverished family which moved in 1896 to Temesvár (today
            Timişoara, Romania).[1] He completed the elementary school in Pančevo, and Grammar school in Timişoara. Then
            he started attending the Export academy in Rijeka in 1912, and in the autumn of the following year he
            started studying in Vienna.[1]

            At the beginning of World War I, Crnjanski was persecuted as part of the general anti-Serbian retribution of
            Austria to Princip's assassination in Sarajevo. Instead of being sent to jail, he was drafted to the
            Austro-Hungarian Army and sent to Galician front to fight against the Russians – where he was wounded in
            1915.[citation needed] Crnjanski convalesced in a Vienna war hospital, although just before the end of the
            war he was sent to the Italian front. After the war, and graduated in literary studies from the University
            of Belgrade.[1] There he studied under of the literature critic Bogdan Popovic.[citation needed]</p>
